The aim of this project consists in quantifying model risk, in particular in the framework of market
risk measures. You are going to implement simple market risk measures such as VaR or ES
(expected shortfall), and to study different kinds of model risk. Please note that your VaR and ES
must be estimated on the daily price returns and not on the price itself. All risk measures will be
at a one-day horizon.
